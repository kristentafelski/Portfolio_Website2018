      <h2>About Me</h2>
       <h4>I’m Kristen Tafelski, a student at Cab Calloway School of the Arts. I’m finishing up my junior year of high school as a visual major, and over the past 3 years I've been able to grow and develop my artistic skills with the variety of arts classes cab offers, and I'm really proud of the artist I am becoming. The art displayed on this web page are some of my favorite pieces I've created over the last few years, and in the years to come I hope to continue growing as an artist and discover where my creative skills can take me. </h4>

       <h3>Photography</h3>
        <p>For my junior year of high school, I decided to take Cab’s photography class, a course split between taking photos for the school yearbook as well as creative projects. This class helped me to improve and grow immensely in my abilities and understanding of photography. Throughout the class, along with building some professional skills with the photo assignments for yearbook, I’ve been able to begin developing my own artistic ideas in the realm of photography, an area I had not had a lot of experience in before this year.My photography in this course conveys a lot of personal exploration as I learned different techniques and approaches to interacting with and capturing light. The one dominant element throughout all of my projects this year that may or may not be obvious to an onlooker is that element of exploration, I was learning methods of creating I had no previous experience in, my work essentially being my own experimentation with these new ideas to gain an understanding of them and then to convey that understanding.</p>

       <h3>Digital Media</h3>
        <p>Since starting school at Cab, I have taken two digital media and imaging courses, Digital Media 1 and 2. Digital Media 1 was generally about developing basic skills in graphic design and Adobe programs like Photoshop and Illustrator. We completed a lot of fun projects to help us grow an understanding of the techniques and programs we learned, including a Surrealism Project. That project had us scanning in images from National Geographic as well as any analogue sketches we might have drawn, and enhancing and manipulating them in photoshop to create something new. Digital Media 2 took the skills we learned from Digital Media 1 and further developed them as well as introducing new ideas, primarily web design. The final product of Digital Media 2 is a portfolio website, the website you're reading this from right now!</p>

       <h3>Visual</h3>
        <p>Since becoming a student at cab, I've taken three visual arts courses to develop my abilities. Foundations 1 and 2 in my first two years of high school, which essentially taught and developed basic skills in the visual arts, understanding and utilizing the elements of art and design, as well as learning different techniques and ideas. The first two years are like the base, or “foundation”, that you need as a visual artist, and once you grasp that, you take the next step and branch out. As a junior, I took 2D design, a course focusing more on the design and composition of creating art pieces. I learned a lot of new concepts and techniques, one of my favorites being printmaking.</p>
